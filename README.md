﻿fmtconv — format conversion tools for Vapoursynth and Avisynth+
===============================================================

Fmtconv is a format-conversion plug-in for the Vapoursynth and Avisynth+ video processing engines.
It does:
* Resizing.
* Bitdepth conversion with dithering.
* Colorspace conversion (matrix, transfer characteristics and chromatic adaptation).

It supports:
* Pixel data types: 8-–12-, 14- and 16-bit integer, 32-bit float.
* Colorspaces: RGB, Y, YUV, YCoCg, YDzDx and ICtCp in 4:4:4, 4:2:2, 4:2:0 and 4:1:1 chroma subsampling factors.
* Progressive and interlaced content.

Fmtconv is focussed primarily on quality and exactness rather than execution speed.
This does not mean it is slow or unoptimized, but fmtconv is clearly not on par with the fastest equivalent 8-bit filters.

See `doc/fmtconv.html` for more information.
